Hadoop Pipes must be compiled for MAC OS X.:

cd $HADOOP_HOME/src/c++/utils
./configure
make install
cd $HADOOP_HOME/src/c++/pipes
./configure
make install



Include and library path for MAC OS X:

$HADOOP_HOME/src/c++/install/include
$HADOOP_HOME/src/c++/install/lib



Unsolved error on MAC OS X v10.6.7:

configure for pipes ->
checking for HMAC_Init in -lssl... no
configure: error: Cannot find libssl.so

- gcc ... -lssl   is working
- ln -s .../lib/libssl-*.dylib to .../lib/libssl.so   don't solve the error.
- sudo port install openssl   and linking don't solve the error.
- delete the part for SSL in configure is resulting in a compiled version, but the user defined program can't be compiled
